<p>To list all installed packages on Ubuntu, you can use the <code>dpkg</code> command, which is a package manager for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. Here is the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">dpkg --get-selections
</code></pre>
<p>This will list all installed packages. The output will be quite long as it includes every package, including libraries and small utilities.</p>
<p>If you want to see only the major packages that were explicitly installed (not including dependencies), you can use the <code>apt-mark</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">apt-mark showmanual
</code></pre>
<p>This will show a list of packages that were manually installed, which is usually a shorter list and might be closer to what you're interested in.</p>
<p>Remember to run these commands in the terminal.</p>
